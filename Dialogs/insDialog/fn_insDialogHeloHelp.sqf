["<t size='1.3'>Insertion Helicopter Setup</t><br/><br/>
<t size='0.9'>On this screen you can enter a flight path for the insertion helicopters.</t><br/><br/>
<t size='0.9' underline='1'>How To:</t><br/>
<t size='0.9'>1. Select a helicopter from the dropbox.<br/>
2. Click on the map to set as many waypoints as you like.<br/>
3. The last waypoint you set will be the Landing Zone for the helicopter.<br/>
4. When you are done, select the next helicopter and repeat.</t><br/>
<br/>
<t size='0.9' underline='1'>Important to know:</t><br/>
<t size='0.9'>1. You have to set the path for each helicopter.<br/>
2. You can set as many waypoints for each Helicopter as you want, but it is recommended to keep it simple.<br/>
3. Placing waypoints on one another can and most probably will lead to crashes. So keep some space between them.<br/>
4. The helicopters will return to base after they all players exited the vehicle.<br/>
5. If you don't need all helicopters, you don't have to set waypoints, but be aware, that these helicopters will not fly anywhere and won't be usable afterwards!</t>", "Help"] spawn BIS_fnc_guiMessage;
